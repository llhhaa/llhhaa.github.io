I've worked in software since 2012, and am currently a Project Lead at [Custom Ink](https://www.customink.com). I live in [Richmond, Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond,_Virginia).

You may find me writing about how we got here, where we're going, and on whose backs we're making the journey.

And of course, the software, good and bad, we leave piled up behind us.

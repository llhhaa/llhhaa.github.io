A friend of mine is a software project manager; as a product manager, his work is to relieve developers of having to think too hard about what it is they’re making. Before him, the de facto product manager on the team was a staff engineer. You might recognize this arrangement - instead of a dedicated product manager, “product knowledge” inevitably accrues to the most experienced developer on the team, and they wear the hat.

This staff engineer, though, was not satisfied with his reduction in responsibilities. In fact, he was leaving the company. Per my friend, the engineer “wants someone to give him a big hard problem to solve, and then go away for a month and be left alone, and then - voila - come back with a solution.” Every developer needs focus time, but thinking that useful, non-trivial software could be made with only an initial prompt betrays a naiveté for someone so experienced.[^1]

Why do the makers of software have such a strained relationship with the analog world beyond the IDE, past the bezels of the smartphone? For developers it is a friction to be wished away. For startup founders, investors, and other owners, it is something to be boiled down to buttons, forms, feeds, automations, and algorithms. But the analog is not just the starting point for successful code - it is its eternal predicate. The analog world doesn't need code, but code is meaningless without its analog referent.

For professional programmers, this makes decent sense. Their job is, ultimately, to write code; they’re taught this in schools and boot camps, the notion is reinforced in their work. It's been years since lines of code was a fashionable measure of developer productivity, but it seemed obvious at the time - it's the most easily quantifiable part of a developer's work. Even modern measures, like deployment frequency, boil down to code written. Nor are developers typically trained for the non-code parts of their work. They may have a prior background in closely-related fields like design, project management, or writing. But employers that cultivate these abilities in developers are the exception to the rule.

The product management profession itself ratifies this state of affairs. Because managing the product is, in fact, a lot of work, and requires skills quite distinct from programming, it makes organizational sense to specialize the role. For perhaps most developers, understanding the analog world is literally someone else’s job.

Ideally, of course. The reality is that no developer can completely ignore “product” and still create programs that meet the needs of the end-user. However much the product manager does, there is always a long-tail (sometimes an iceberg, depending on the product and its manager) of questions, caveats, and edge-cases for which the developer must do their own research or use their best judgment. Sometimes, they can read the tea leaves of existing code to divine the answers they need. But every developer, invariably, has to make periodic visits to that foreign country, the analog.

Sitting atop the software pyramid are the founders, investors, and business owners who direct swathes of developers, designers, and managers in creating code-based products. These moguls also experience the analog world as a source of friction, but for different reasons. They want to sell the software, or they want its help in selling something else.

Hawking goods makes the mogul no different from, say, a food truck operator. But whereas the food truck operator takes hold of potatoes and peanut oil to make french fries, the owner takes hold of the analog world to make software. The premise of essentially every commercial computer program is that it takes a piece of the world - a process in a firm or bureaucracy, a commercial or social interaction - reifies it in code, and sells it back to human beings that occupy that bit of the world, what we can call the software's analog referent.

Where the developer wants to turn a blind eye to the analog world, the mogul wants to fence it within the boundaries of a computer program. "Software is eating the world", exulted software investor Marc Andreessen in 2011.[^2] For nearly a decade, it looked like his prediction would hold. In retrospect, a more mundane story developed - software's ascendency was the product of certain macroeconomic conditions, namely the zero-interest rate policies of central banks. The salad days of tech have ended along with those policies.[^3]

The other factor was simply time, which all investments need to reveal whether they were wise ones. Software enclosure[^4], we can call it, means (hopefully) coming to some understanding about the analog world, and then flattening the infinite variance, shades of meaning, and interconnectedness of that referent into a discrete product with definite limits on what a user can do. Discerning whether the result is better or worse than the analog thing it strives to replace not only takes time, but is made more difficult by ultra-cheap capital, as it made software companies and their investors willing to bear continued, substantial losses while waiting for their product to surpass - or simply batter down - its referent. The current tech landscape is littered with examples. Perhaps the first was Uber, which is widely regarded as a failed business model.[^5] [^6] Self-checkouts proved to be, at best, a break-even technology, failing to substantially reduce labor costs, increasing theft, and degrading customer experience.[^7] People hate dating apps for the alienating and Sisyphean experience they turned out to be.[^8] Real estate, the "gig economy", brick-and-mortar stores, the list goes on.

Given these extended timeframes, we are just starting to learn how tech capitalists will respond to the analog world slipping out of their code-fences. Predictably, the knee-jerk response is to impose the costs of their misjudgements on those they employ.[^9] Ideally, this will mature into a more measured approach to software-making, an aspiration to augment the world rather than eat it. But I imagine that for many, the messianic faith in software of the 2010s will die hard, and many will conclude not that there are limits to what can be reified in code, but that it needs to be done with greater skill and more technological foresight.

The dramatis personae presented above are precisely that - not whole persons but roles inhabited by them. They are here to clarify, embodying two types of contention with the analog world, contention stem from their position in the software production process. They sound out the relationship between software production and the analog world - from inside the production process, as someone doing the work of making the software; and from atop it, controlling the production process.

Karl Marx gave us the concept of commodity fetishism.[^10] “Fetishism” was taken from early anthropology, referring to the practice of imbuing objects with supernatural meaning, using them to both perform and obscure vital social functions. Marx, ever eager to turn the ideas of the self-declared civilized on their head, turned it around - industrial society makes a fetish of commodities, divorcing the buyer from the who and how of their production. The commodity appears to the buyer, price tag attached, as if by magic.

Our developer and our owner are unconscious practitioners of _code fetishism_. If the commodity stands in for and obscures its own production, code stands in for and obscures - or tries to - the analog world it’s meant to crystallize. Developers must because they must think through the code and take on its perspective to write it. Owners must because, well, that’s the business. They both have the conviction - at times hubris - that code can be a compelling-enough simulacra of the analog world.
